# REST API reference

You can use REST APIs for most operations in OpenSearch. The OpenSearch REST API reference includes the REST API paths, HTTP verbs, supported parameters, request body details, and example responses.

Most REST APIs are included here and we are working to get full coverage. If any are missing, feel free to enter feedback or submit a pull request.
