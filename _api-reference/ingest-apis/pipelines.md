# Pipelines

Ingest pipelines in OpenSearch are managed using ingest API operations. When using ingest in production environments, your cluster should contain at least one node with the node roles permission set to `ingest`. For more information on setting up node roles within a cluster, see the [Creating a cluster]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/tuning-your-cluster/index/) section.
