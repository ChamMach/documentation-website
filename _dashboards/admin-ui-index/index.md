# Admin UI for index operations in OpenSearch Dashboards
Introduced 2.5
{: .label .label-purple }

The admin user interface (UI) for index operation allows you to perform common index operations through a user-friendly interface and prevent unintentional changes. While there have been some administration user experiences in OpenSearch Dashboards (ISM, Alerting on HTTP inputs, Security, etc.), there is now a unified web UI experience for cluster administrators to manage their deployment's indexes.
