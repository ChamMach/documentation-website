# Admin UI for index operations in OpenSearch Dashboards
Introduced 2.5
{: .label .label-purple }

The admin user interface (UI) for index operation allows you to perform common index operations through a user-friendly interface and prevent unintentional changes.

The admin UI interface allows you to perform basic cluster administrative operations, or to view cluster health metrics and status. While there have been some administration user experiences in OpenSearch Dashboards (ISM, Alerting on HTTP inputs, Security, etc.), there is now a unified web UI experience for cluster administrators to administer their deployments.
