# Welcome

Students, educators, and researchers are key drivers of technological innovation, and the OpenSearch Project invites you to be part of its journey as a distributed, community-driven, Apache 2.0-licensed, 100% open-source search and analytics software suite. Your contributions to the project will help build a more powerful suite of search, analytics, and observability applications for users like you.
