# Welcome

Students, educators, and researchers are key drivers of technological innovation, and the OpenSearch Project invites you to be part of its journey as a distributed, community-driven, Apache 2.0-licensed, 100% open-source search and analytics software suite. 

The college student contributor initiative for OpenSearch Dashboards is growing to provide students more access and exposure to open source projects. Students will be introduced to open source and will gain education, technical training, and career development in open source through their contributions to an open source project.  

This tutorial series guides students through contributing to Dashboards development. Students will learn:

- [How to contribute to Dashboards](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards)
- [How to install OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/quickstart/) 
- [How to configure OpenSearch Dashboards]
- [How to install Dashboards plugins]
