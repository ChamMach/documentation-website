# Dashboard

A dashboard condenses multiple data visualizations in to a single view, allowing you to visualize and review data at a glance. Using the Dashboard feature in OpenSearch Dashboards, you can interact with your data in real time and customize data visualizations to track metrics and extract actionable insights. With this high-level graphical display of key metrics, decision-makers, data analysts, and casual business users are empowered to make better better decisions.
