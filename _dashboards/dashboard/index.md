# Dashboard

A dashboard condenses multiple data visualizations into a single view, allowing you to visualize and review data at a glance while giving you different views into your data.

With Dashboard you can:

- Get started with pre-built panels and dashboards and customize display properties to create the dashboard you need.
- Analyze, monitor, and alarm on metrics, logs, and traces across multiple data sources.
- Create interactive dashboards and share them with anyone in your organization.
