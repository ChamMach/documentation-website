- **Improved efficiency:** With a list of plugins readily available from a dashboard, you can enable, disable, update, or remove them with just a few clicks.
- **Better troubleshooting:** Viewing a list of plugins from a dashboard can help you quickly identify which plugins may be causing a problem.
- **Enhanced security:** With a list of plugins readily available from a dashboard, you can easily see if any outdated or vulnerable plugins are present and then quickly remove or update them, minimizing or avoiding security risks.
- **Improved website performance:** Viewing a list of plugins from a dashboard can help you identify any plugins that may be slowing down your website or causing performance issues.
