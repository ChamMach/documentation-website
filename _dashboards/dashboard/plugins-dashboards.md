# Managing plugins with Dashboards

Introduced 2.7
{: .label .label-purple }

Plugins are integrated automatically into the **Dashboards** application to allow you to manage them within a dashboard. A dashboard view of your installed plugins provides for:

- **Easy access to installed plugins:** Viewing a list of plugins on a dashboard view displays all the plugins in one place to better configure and manage them.
- **Improved efficiency:** With a list of plugins readily available on a dashboard view, you can enable, disable, update, or remove them with just a few clicks.
- **Better troubleshooting:** Viewing a list of plugins on a dashboard view can help you quickly identify which plugins may be causing a problem.
- **Enhanced security:** With a list of plugins on a dashboard view, you can easily see if any outdated or vulnerable plugins are present and then quickly remove or update them, minimizing or avoiding security risks.
- **Improved website performance:** Viewing a list of plugins on a dashboard view can help you identify any plugins that may be slowing down your website or causing performance issues.
