Introduced 2.8
{: .label .label-purple }

With OpenSearch Dashboards' alerting and anomaly detection features, you can localize and address system performance issues before they reach other parts of your system. You have two options in OpenSearch Dashboards to create alert monitors and anomaly detectors to monitor your system's performance: the Discover application or the Alerting and Anomaly Detection plugins. In this tutorial you'll learn to use the Discover application to create and manage alert monitors and anomaly detectors and visualize them on a dashboard.
