# Managing alerting monitors and anomaly detectors
Introduced 2.7
{: .label .label-purple }

You have two options in OpenSearch Dashboards to manage and create alerts and detectors. Those options are using the OpenSearch Dashboards **Discover** application or using the the Alerting and Anomaly Detection plugins.

In this tutorial you'll learn to use the Discover application to examine specific data points and detect occurrences into how your systems are performing. If you want to learn about using the plugins, see [Alerting]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observing-your-data/alerting/index/) and [Anomaly Detection]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observing-your-data/ad/index/) topics in the [Observability]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observing-your-data/index/) section of the OpenSearch Documentation.
