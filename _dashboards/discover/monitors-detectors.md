Introduced 2.7
{: .label .label-purple }

You have two options in OpenSearch Dashboards to manage and create alerts and detectors so that you have insight into how your system is performing. Those options are using the OpenSearch Dashboards **Discover** application or using the the Alerting and Anomaly Detection plugins.

In this tutorial you'll learn to use the Discover application create and manage alerts and detectors so that you can localize and address issues before they reach other parts of your system. If you want to learn about using the plugins, see [Alerting]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observing-your-data/alerting/index/) and [Anomaly Detection]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observing-your-data/ad/index/) topics in the [Observability]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observing-your-data/index/) section of the OpenSearch Documentation.
