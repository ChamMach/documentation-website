Introduced 2.7
{: .label .label-purple }

You have two options in OpenSearch Dashboards to create anomaly detection alerts for your system's performance: the OpenSearch Dashboards **Discover** application or the Alerting and Anomaly Detection plugins. With OpenSearch Dashboards' alerting and anomaly detection, you can localize and address issues before they reach other parts of your system.

In this tutorial you'll learn to use the Discover application create alerts view a graph of the metric data.  If you want to learn about using the plugins, see [Alerting]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observing-your-data/alerting/index/) and [Anomaly Detection]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observing-your-data/ad/index/) topics in the [Observability]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observing-your-data/index/) section of the OpenSearch Documentation.
