# Composite index templates

Composite index templates allow you to create a single index pattern that matches multiple indexes. This pattern can include wildcards or regular expressions, enabling you to apply the same setting or mapping to multiple indexes simultaneously. 

Using them with [index templates]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/im-plugin/index-templates/) can be a powerful tool for managing large volumes of data. You can create an index template that defines the basic structure and settings of your indexes, and then use the composite index template to apply the settings to all indexes that match a specific pattern or criteria.

Learn how to use the OpenSearch Dashboards user interface to create and manage composite index templates in the following tutorial.
