# Visualizing data in OpenSearch Dashboards

Data visualization is the process of using visual elements like charts, graphs, or maps to represent data. It translates complex, high-volume, or numerical data into a visual representation that is easier to process. 

OpenSearch Dashboards gives you data visualization tools to improve and automate the visual communication process for accuracy and detail. You can use the visual representations to extract actionable insights from raw data.

# Visualization types

OpenSearch Dashboards offers several visualization types (see image below) to support different use cases. Learn more about each visualization type at the visualization's respective web page.
