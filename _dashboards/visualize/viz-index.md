# Visualizations

Data visualization is the process of using visual elements like charts, graphs, or maps to represent data. It translates complex, high-volume, or numerical data into a visual representation that is easier to process.

OpenSearch Dashboards gives you data visualization tools to improve and automate the visual communication process. Using visual elements like charts, graphs, or maps to represent data, gives you the tools to advance business intelligence and support data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.

# Visualization types in OpenSearch Dashboards

Dashboards offers several visualization types to support different use cases for you to translate complex, high-volume, or numerical data into a visual representation that is easier to process.

## Area charts:  Basic and stacked

Area charts depict changes over time, and they are commonly used to show trends. For example, you can use area charts to more efficiently identify patterns in your log data,such as sales data for a time range and trends over that time.

## Bar charts

Bar charts compare two or more data factors and demonstrate changes of one variable over a period of time. For example, you may use a bar graph to represent packaging sales by color in the last month.

## Data tables

Data tables, or tables, show your data in tabular form. Using data tables when you want to see individual values in raw form or examine specific values. For example, you may use data tables for financial analysis.

## Gantt chart

Gantt charts show the start, end, and duration of unique events in a sequence. Gantt charts are useful in trace analytics, telemetry, and anomaly detection use cases, where you want to understand interactions and dependencies between various events in a schedule. For example, consider an index of log data. The fields in a typical set of log data, especially audit logs, contain a specific operation or event with a start time and duration.

## Gauge charts

A gauge chart is similar to a nondigital gauge, for example a gas gauge in an automobile. It displays how much there is of the thing you are measuring. In a gauge chart, this measurement can exist alone or in relation to another measurement. Each color section in a gauge chart represents one value. For example, you may use a gauge to compare actual sales to the sales goal.

## Maps

Maps show the difference between data values for a geographic location, such as a country, state or province, or city. For example, you may use a map for asset tracking and location-based marketing.
