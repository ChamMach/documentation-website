# Visualize data

Data visualization is the process of using visual elements like charts, graphs, or maps to represent data. It translates complex, high-volume, or numerical data into a visual representation that is easier to process. 

OpenSearch Dashboards gives you data visualization tools to improve and automate the visual communication process. Using visual elements like charts, graphs, or maps to represent data, you can advance business intelligence and support data-driven decision-making and strategic planning.

# Visualization types

Dashboards offers several visualization types to support different use cases for you to translate complex, high-volume, or numerical data into a visual representation that is easier to process. Visit each visualization type's webpage to learn more about the data visualization type and how to use it.
