# Managing Data Prepper

You can perform administrator functions for Data Prepper, including basic configuration, interacting with core APIs, Log4j configuration, monitoring, and using Peer Forwarder. Peer Forwarder allows you to use it as an HTTP service to peer forward an `event` between Data Prepper nodes for aggregation.
