# csv

## Overview

The `csv` processor takes in an event and parses its comma-separated values (CSV) data into columns.

Option | Required | Type | Description
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
source | No | String | The field in the Event that will be parsed. Default value is `message`.
quote_character | No | String | The character used as a text qualifier for a single column of data. Default value is double quote `"`.
delimiter | No | String | The character separating each column. Default value is `,`.
delete_header | No | Boolean | If specified, the header on the Event (`column_names_source_key`) deletes after the event is parsed. If thereâ€™s no header on the event, no actions is taken. Default value is true.
column_names_source_key | No | String | The field in the Event that specifies the CSV column names, which will be autodetected. If there must be extra column names, the column names autogenerate according to their index. If `column_names` is also defined, the header in `column_names_source_key` can also be used to generate the event fields. If too few columns are specified in this field, the remaining column names autogenerate. If too many column names are specified in this field, the CSV processor omits the extra column names.
column_names | No | List | User-specified names for the CSV columns. Default value is `[column1, column2, ..., columnN]` if there are N columns of data in the CSV record and `column_names_source_key` is not defined. If `column_names_source_key` is defined, the header in `column_names_source_key` generates the Event fields. If too few columns are specified in this field, the remaining column names will autogenerate. If too many column names are specified in this field, CSV processor omits the extra column names.

## Metrics

Apart from common metrics in [AbstractProcessor](https://github.com/opensearch-project/data-prepper/blob/main/data-prepper-api/src/main/java/org/opensearch/dataprepper/model/processor/AbstractProcessor.java), the `csv` processor introduces the following custom metrics:

**Counter**

* `csvInvalidEvents`: The number of invalid events. An invalid event causes an exception to be thrown when parsed. An unclosed quote usually causes this exception. 

<!--- Editorial: "...exception to be thrown" - is this something we should rework for clarity, or can we keep it as-is?--->
