# Appendix

Validation was performed by upgrading an Elasticsearch 7.10.2 cluster to OpenSearch 1.3.7; however, this process can be applied to any **Nâ†’N+1** version upgrade of OpenSearch on any platform. Certain commands, such as listing running containers in Docker, are included as an aid to the reader, but the specific commands used on your host(s) will be different depending on your distribution and host operating system.
