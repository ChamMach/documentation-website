# Appendix

You can refer to this appendix for additional supporting documentation, such as example API requests and configuration files that were used for testing and validation of the upgrade process. If you would like to request specific topics to include in this appendix, please comment on the [upgrade and migration documentation meta issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website/issues/2830) in the [OpenSearch Project](https://github.com/opensearch-project) on GitHub.

Specific commands are included in this appendix to serve as examples of interacting with the OpenSearch API, and the underlying host, in order to demonstrate the steps described in the related upgrade process documents. The intention is not to be overly prescriptive, but instead to add context for users who are new to OpenSearch and want to see practical examples.
