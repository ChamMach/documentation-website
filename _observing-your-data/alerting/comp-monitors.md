## About composite monitors

Basic [monitor types]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observing-your-data/alerting/monitors/#monitor-types) for the Alerting plugin are designed to define a single trigger type. For example, a document level monitor can trigger an alert based on a query's match with documents, while a bucket level monitor can trigger an alert based on queries aimed at aggregated values in a data source. The composite monitor extends the usefulness of the individual monitor types by providing functionality that can chain the output of multiple monitor types into a single workflow that includes multiple triggers and permits analysis of a data source based on multiple criteria. This allows you to derive more granular information about a data source without requiring you to manually coordinate the scheduling of the separate monitors.

Composite monitors solve several limitations with basic monitors in the following ways:

* Composite monitors give you the ability to create complex queries through a combination of triggers generated by multiple types of monitors.
* They have the capacity to define a pipeline of rules and queries that are run as a single execution.
* They can chain together individual monitors so that the output of one can act as the input for the next, repeating this through the entire sequence of the execution.
* They provide a more complete view of a given data source by running multiple monitors and multiple types of monitors in sequence, creating finer focused results and reducing noise in the results.

## Key terms

The key terms in the following table describe the basic concepts behind composite monitors. For additional terms common to all types of monitors, see [Key terms]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/observing-your-data/alerting/monitors/#key-terms).

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| Composite monitor | A combination of multiple individual monitors that includes functionality to execute each monitor separately in sequence. The compound monitor can query different aspects of a dataset based on the type of monitors included in the composite monitor's definition.  |
| Delegate monitor | Any monitor of any monitor type used in the chained workflow of a compound monitor. Delegate monitors are executed sequentially according to their order in the monitor definition. |
| Findings chain | 
| Alert chain | Conditions that, if met, generate *alerts*. |
| Execution | A single run of all delegate monitors in the sequence defined in the composite monitor's configuration. |
| Execution schema | Conditions that, if met, generate *alerts*. |
| Execution Id | Allows for the management of data recorded from a specific execution. The execution Id associates findings and alerts with the execution and is stored in each monitor's metadata. |

## Example workflows

When 

Each monitor included in a composite monitor is assigned a monitor Id to distinguish it in the execution's sequence. The order of their sequence is determined during configuration. Configurations   are designed to chain both findings and alerts. Both of these options are discussed in some detail in the following sections.

### Chained findings

A composite monitor can chain findings from mulitple monitors to help you gain more insight about events happening in your data sources. To illustrate this, consider the following example. 

The following image shows the simplified workflow of a compound monitor.
