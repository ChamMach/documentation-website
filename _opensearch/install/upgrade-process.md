# Upgrade Process

Before upgrading your OpenSearch cluster, you should take time to plan the process. How long will the upgrade process take? If your cluster is being used in production, how impactful is downtime? Do you have infrastructure in place to stand up the new cluster in a dev environment for testing before you move it into production?



Consider how impactful downtime might be for your workflow. Have any plugin implementations changed between versions?
