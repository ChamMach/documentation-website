# Customizing search results

To improve the relevancy of search results within your application, you can customize search results using the following functionality:

Feature | Description
:--- | :---
[Autocomplete functionality]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-query/customizing-search/autocomplete/) | Suggest phrases as the user types.
[Did-you-mean functionality]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-query/customizing-search/did-you-mean/) | Check spelling of phrases as the user types.
[Paginate results]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-query/customizing-search/paginate/) | Rather than a single, long list, separate search results into pages.
[Sort results]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-query/customizing-search/sort/) | Allow sorting of results by different criteria.
[Highlight query matches]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}t/search-query/customizing-search/highlight/) | Highlight the search term in the results.
[Search relevance]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}t/search-query/search-relevance/) | Compare two queries to see which produces a better result.
