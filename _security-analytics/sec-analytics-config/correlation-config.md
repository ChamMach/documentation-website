# Creating correlation rules

Correlation rules allow you to define relevant threat scenarios between different individual systems in an infrastructure by creating connections between the systems' log source fields. Once the rule contains the preferred fields and field values that define an intended threat secenario, it can query findings generated by system detectors and draw and store any correlations found between log events.

Follow the steps in this section to begin creating correlation rules.

1. Begin by selecting **Security Analytics** in the Dashboards home page menu. Then select **Correlaion rules** from the Security Analytics menu on the left side of the screen. The **Correlation rules** page is displayed. 
1. Select **Create correlation rule** tab is displayed. Select the **Configure** tab to display the dynamic settings for multi-tenancy.
