# Creating custom log types

Log types represent the different sources of data used for threat detection in Security Analytics. In addition to the standard log types supported by Security Analytics, you can create custom log types for your threat detectors. Follow the steps here to create a custom log type.


## The Log types page

To navigate to the **Log types** page, select **Log types** under **Detectors** in the navigation menu. The image that follows shows the **Log types** landing page.

The table that lists the log types provides the name of the log type, its description, and identifies whether it's based on the industry standard Sigma rule or a custom log type. 

* Select the log type **Name** to open the log type's details page. The **Details** tab is shown by default. You can also select the **Detection rules** tab to show all detection rules associated with the log type.
  
  In this view there are options to filter the list of rules by **Log type** (helpful in the case where a rule is associated to more than one log type), **Rule severity**, and **Source**. Select the **Rule name** to open details for the detection rule.

* In the **Actions** column, you can select the trash can icon ({::nomarkdown}<img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/images/alerting/trash-can-icon.png" class="inline-icon" alt="trash can icon"/>{:/}) to delete a log type. Follow the prompts to confirm your intentions and safely remove the log type.
* Select **Create log type** in the top, right corner of the screen to begin creating a custom log type. The **Create log type** window opens. Continue with the steps in the section that follows to create a custom log type.


## Creating a custom log type

After selecting **Create log type** in the **Log types** page, the **Create log type** window opens and provides the necessary fields to create a new log type:

1. Enter a name for the log type.
  
  The log type name supports characters a-z (lower case), 0-9, hyphens, and underscores.
  {: .note }

1. Enter a description for the log type.
1. Select **Create rule category** in the lower, right corner of the screen. The screen returns to the **Log types** window, and the new log type appears in the list of all log types. Note that the source for the new log type indicates **Custom**.
