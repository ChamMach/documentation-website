# Working with the correlation graph

The correlation engine is an experimental feature released in OpenSearch 2.7. Therefore, we do not recommend enabling the feature in a production environment at this time. For updates on the progress of correlation engine, see [Security Analytics Correlation Engine](https://github.com/opensearch-project/security-analytics/issues/369) at GitHub. To share ideas and provide feedback, join the [Security Analytics forum](https://forum.opensearch.org/c/plugins/security-analytics/73).

The correlation graph is a security findings knowledge graph. It provides a visualization for information generated by the correlation engine and allows you to focus on specific correlations and inspect them in greater detail. Information in the graph includes findings by log type, severity levels for the findings, the correlations drawn between findings, and the strength of the correlations, among other details. You can also manipulate the graph to gain further insights into specific events of interest. This includes setting a date range for findings and their correlations, zooming in on the relationship between specific findings, and filtering by log type and severity level. Use this section to learn more about using the graph. 

## Acccessing the graph

Begin by selecting **Security Analytics** in the Dashboards home page menu. Then select **Correlations** from the Security Analytics menu on the left side of the screen. The **Correlations** page is displayed.
