# On-behalf-of tokens

On-behalf-of tokens enable services to run on OpenSearch by allowing a user's security privileges to authorize access on behalf of the service. These tokens can be used for any generic service that you want to run on OpenSearch. However, their initial and current application with OpenSearch involves the support of Security extension functionality.
