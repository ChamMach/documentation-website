# Crypto plugin

The Crypto plugin provides client side encryption and decryption for OpenSearch. This allows for the encryption of data transferred between OpenSearch and a remote storage service to support features such as [Remote-backed storage]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/tuning-your-cluster/availability-and-recovery/remote-store/index/) or backup of [Snapshots]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/tuning-your-cluster/availability-and-recovery/snapshots/index/). However, the plugin is not limited to this type of application alone and can be used for local encryption as well.

Using the plugin to encrypt data requires a cypher key—sometimes called a data key—and a key provider service to generate it. The plugin is extensible and therefore supports any number of key providers and key management systems (KMS).

## Terms

The following table includes terms that are relevant to the Crypto plugin and its process.

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| Data key | A cipher or cryptographic key generated by a key provider. The data key is used to encrypt or decrypt the data itself, while a second type of key (for example, a master key) is typically used to encrypt or decrypt the data key. Together they form a key pair. |
| Repository | A storage service where the encrypted data is kept. |
| Key provider | The key management service that generates and rotates the keys. |
| Repository | A storage service where the encrypted data is kept. |
| Storage service | The service that houses the repository for data storage. |


## Hi-level process for encryption

The Crypto plugin is responsible for encrypting and decrypting data moving to and from OpenSearch. It relies on a key provider to generate the key pairs and rotate them at regular intervals. This section provides a high-level overview of the basic encryption process using the [Remote-backed storage]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/tuning-your-cluster/availability-and-recovery/remote-store/index/) feature.

1. Upon launch of OpenSearch, the Crypto plugin is loaded and, in turn, loads available extensions for unique key providers.
1. The user registers the repository that will be used to contain encrypted data. Registration of the repository involves sending a request that includes an encryption configuration. The configuration provides a method to specify settings for both the remote storage service and the key provider. For more information about the configuration, see [Registering a repository].

Once a repository is registered, the settings in the configuration cannot be changed without potentially corrupting the data uploaded from or downloaded to the repository. This includes the setting for specifying whether the repository is encrypted or un-enctrypted. 
{: .important }

1. Based on the configuration, the plugin registers the key providers, which begins the process of generating and rotating key pairs at regular intervals. These new key pairs are cached in the Crypto plugin.
1. The user sends a request to [create an index]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/api-reference/index-apis/create-index/) for the data. Transfer of data happens in the background.
1. The Crypto plugin uses the cached key pairs to encrypt the data.
1. The encrypted data is then uploaded to the configured repository by remote store.

## External libraries

Software dependencies are mainly AWS v2 SDK. The following is a list of dependencies:

1. AWS encryption SDK (com.amazonaws:aws-encryption-sdk-java) - Some classes are modified to support encryption or decryption of partial content.
2. Bouncy castle (org.bouncycastle:bcprov-ext-jdk15on)  : Used by encryption SDK for core crypto ops.
3. Apache commons (org.apache.commons:commons-lang3) - Again used by encryption SDK for basic object validations.
4. Junit dependencies - For tests
