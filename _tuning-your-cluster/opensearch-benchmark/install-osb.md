# Installing OpenSearch Benchmark

You can install OpenSearch Benchmark directly on a host running Linux or macOS or you can run OpenSearch Benchmark in a Docker container on any compatible host. This section of documentation describes high-level considerations for your OpenSearch Benchmark host, as well as instructions for installing OpenSearch Benchmark.

Some OpenSearch Benchmark functionality is unavailable when you run OpenSearch Benchmark in a Docker container. Specifically, the following restrictions apply:
- You cannot distribute load worker coordinator hosts.
- You can only use the `benchmark-only` pipeline.

## Hardware considerations

OpenSearch Benchmark can be used to deploy OpenSearch nodes for testing. If you intend to leverage this functionality in your environment, then you will need to install OpenSearch Benchmark directly on each host where you plan to deploy an OpenSearch node. Additionally, you must configure each host for OpenSearch. See [Installing OpenSearch]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/install-opensearch/index/) for guidance about important host settings that you must change.

You should also think about which workloads you want to run. To see a list of default workload specifications for OpenSearch Benchmark, visit the [opensearch-benchmark-workloads](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-benchmark-workloads) repository on GitHub. As a general rule, make sure that the OpenSearch Benchmark host has enough free storage space to store the compressed data and the full decompressed data corpus once OpenSearch Benchmark is installed.

If you want to benchmark with a default workload, then use the following table to determine the approximate minimum amount of required free space needed by adding the compressed size with the uncompressed size:

| Workload Name | Document Count | Compressed Size | Uncompressed Size |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| eventdata | 20,000,000 | 756.0 MB | 15.3 GB |
| geonames | 11,396,503 | 252.9 MB | 3.3 GB |
| geopoint | 60,844,404 | 482.1 MB | 2.3 GB |
| geopointshape | 60,844,404 | 470.8 MB | 2.6 GB |
| geoshape | 60,523,283 | 13.4 GB | 45.4 GB |
| http_logs | 247,249,096 | 1.2 GB | 31.1 GB |
| nested | 11,203,029 | 663.3 MB | 3.4 GB |
| noaa | 33,659,481 | 949.4 MB | 9.0 GB |
| nyc_taxis | 165,346,692 | 4.5 GB | 74.3 GB |
| percolator | 2,000,000 | 121.1 kB | 104.9 MB |
| pmc | 574,199 | 5.5 GB | 21.7 GB |
| so | 36,062,278 | 8.9 GB | 33.1 GB |

Lastly, your OpenSearch Benchmark host should use solid-state drives (SSDs) for storage because they perform significantly faster at read and write operations than traditional spinning disk hard drives. If your host uses spinning disk hard drives, then you might observe performance bottlenecking which can skew benchmark results.

## Software dependencies

OpenSearch Benchmark has a few software dependencies based on your specific use case. If you only intend to benchmark existing clusters, then you only need to install the [required software](#required-software). If you plan to run OpenSearch on the same host, however, then there is [additional optional software](#additional-optional-software) that you need to install.

**Important**: If you want to run OpenSearch Benchmark in a Docker container then you can skip to [Finishing the installation](#finishing-the-installation). The OpenSearch Benchmark image contains all of the required software dependencies so there are no additional steps for you to take.
{: .important}

### Required software

OpenSearch Benchmark is written in the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and requires **Python 3.8 or newer** and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), the package installer for Python.

Check your Python 3 version with the following command:
```bash
python3 --version
```
{% include copy.html %}

If a compatible version of Python 3 isn't installed, then we recommend using a Python management tool like [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). pyenv makes For installation instructions, see the pyenv [Installation](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation) documentation.

Lastly, confirm that pip is installed on the host:
```bash
pip3 --version
```
{% include copy.html %}

For information about installing pip, see the official [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

### Additional optional software

You may need to install additional software on the host if any of the following apply:
- You want to use OpenSearch Benchmark to deploy a local instance of OpenSearch.
- You want to run a benchmark using a default workload.

#### Deploying a local instance of OpenSearch

When you use OpenSearch Benchmark to deploy a local instance of OpenSearch, the same requirements apply to the host as they would if you were manually installing OpenSearch. You must configure [important settings]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/install-and-configure/install-opensearch/index/#important-settings), which includes increasing the maximum memory map count and installing an appropriate JDK version.

[Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) must also be installed because OpenSearch Benchmark uses Docker Compose to deploy a local container for testing.

#### Running a benchmark using a default workload

OpenSearch Benchmark requires Git 1.9 or newer to retrieve default workloads from the [opensearch-benchmark-workloads](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-benchmark-workloads) repository on GitHub. Git is preinstalled on macOS. If your OpenSearch Benchmark host uses Linux, then you should refer to the Linux installation instructions for [git](https://git-scm.com/download/linux).

## Finishing the installation

The last steps of the installation will depend on your host environment. If you are installing OpenSearch Benchmark directly on a Linux or macOS host, then you can use pip to install the package. Otherwise, if you are running OpenSearch Benchmark in a Docker container, then you only need to pull down the image and invoke `docker run` with the desired arguments.

### Installing on Linux and macOS

After the prerequisites are installed, you can install OpenSearch Benchmark using either of the following commands:

Using `pip3`:
```bash
pip3 install opensearch-benchmark
```
{% include copy.html %}

Using `python3`:
```bash
python3 -m pip install opensearch-benchmark
```
{% include copy.html %}

You can display information about usage and syntax by passing `-h` or `--help`:
```bash
opensearch-benchmark -h
```
{% include copy.html %}

### Installing with Docker

You can find official images for OpenSearch Benchmark on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/opensearchproject/opensearch-benchmark) or on the [Amazon ECR Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/opensearchproject/opensearch-benchmark).

Pull the image from Docker Hub:
```bash
docker pull opensearchproject/opensearch-benchmark:latest
```
{% include copy.html %}

Pull the image from Amazon ECR Public Gallery:
```bash
docker pull public.ecr.aws/opensearchproject/opensearch-benchmark:latest
```
{% include copy.html %}

To run OpenSearch Benchmark, use `docker run` to launch a container with the desired arguments. For example, the following command will print the help text for OpenSearch Benchmark to the command line:
```bash
docker run opensearchproject/opensearch-benchmark opensearch-benchmark -h
```
{% include copy.html %}

OpenSearch Benchmark will exit with an error if no arguments are supplied. If you want to test the installation, use the `-h` option to print the help text in the command line.
{: .warning}

The following example command pulls down the latest OpenSearch Benchmark image from the Amazon ECR Public Gallery. It then runs the `geonames` workload against an OpenSearch cluster with default security settings at address `https://198.51.100.25:9200`:
```bash
docker run public.ecr.aws/opensearchproject/opensearch-benchmark:latest opensearch-benchmark execute_test --target-hosts https://198.51.100.25:9200 --pipeline benchmark-only --workload geonames --client-options basic_auth_user:admin,basic_auth_password:admin,verify_certs:false
```
{% include copy.html %}
