The maintainers of the OpenSearch Project documentation-website repo seek to promote an inclusive and engaged community of contributors. In order to facilitate this, triage meetings are open to all, and attendance is encouraged for anyone who hopes to contribute, discuss an issue, or learn more about the project. To learn more about contributing to the OpenSearch Project documentation-website repo visit the [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation.

### Do I need to attend for my issue to be addressed/triaged?

Attendance is not required for your issue to be triaged or addressed. All new issues are triaged weekly.


### What happens if my issue does not get covered this time?

Each meeting we seek to address all new issues. If you have an issue you would like to discuss but do not have the ability to attend the entire meeting, please attend when is best for you and signal that you have an issue to discuss when you arrive. If we run out of time before your issue is discussed, you are always welcome to attend the next meeting or follow up on the issue post itself. 

### How do I join the documentation triage meeting?

Meetings are hosted regularly (time/date - TBD) and can be joined via the links posted on the [Upcoming Events](https://opensearch.org/events) webpage.

After joining the Zoom meeting, you can enable your video / voice to join the discussion.  If you do not have a webcam or microphone available, you can still join in and use the text chat.

If you have an issue you'd like to bring forth consider getting a link to the issue so it can be presented to everyone in the meeting.

### Is there an agenda for each week?

Meetings are lightly structured as follows:

1. Introductions and rules: We'll introduce the experts on the call and establish ground rules for the meeting.
1. Announcements: This is an opportunity to introduce major documentation initiatives or changes to the contribution process. 
1. Open discussion: We open the floor in case anyone wants to highlight an issue.
1. Review of new issues: The meetings always start with reviewing all untriaged [issues](https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Auntriaged) for the documentation-website repository.
1. Review of external PRs: We'll review all open external [PRs](https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website/pulls), starting with the oldest.
1. Backlog discussion: We'll review issues from the [backlogs](https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%221+-+Backlog%22) of the documentation-website repository.
1. Help wanted issues: We'll look at the [help-wanted labeled issues](https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Help+wanted%22
)  (contributing is optional). 
There is no specific ordering within each category.

### Do I need to have already contributed to the project to attend a triage meeting?

No, all are welcome and encouraged to attend. Attending the documentation triage meetings is a great way for a new contributor to learn about the project as well as explore different avenues of contribution.

### What if I have an issue that is almost a duplicate, should I open a new one to be triaged?

You can always open an [issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website/issues/new) including one that you think may be a duplicate. However, in cases where you believe there is an important distinction to be made between an existing issue and your newly created one, you are encouraged to attend the triaging meeting to explain.

### What if I have follow-up questions on an issue?

If you have an existing issue you would like to discuss, you can always comment on the issue itself. Alternatively, you are welcome to come to the triage meeting to discuss. There you can find answers to many common questions as well as speak with implementation experts.


### Who should I contact if I have further questions?

You can always file an [issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website/issues/new) for any question you have about the project. Alternatively, you can reach out to [specific contacts](https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website/blob/main/README.md#points-of-contact) who maintain the documentation-website repo.
